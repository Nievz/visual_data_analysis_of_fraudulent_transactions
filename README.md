<h3 align="center">Visual Data Analysis Of Fraudulent Transactions</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Fraud is prevalent today, regardless of the size of your business. Even though there are emerging technologies that use machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect fraud, many cases of fraud detection still require robust data analytics to identify abnormal charges.

This project will analyze historical credit card transactions and consumption patterns using SQL Database analysis in order to identify possible fraudulent transactions.

# Data Modeling
We created an entity relationship diagram (ERD) by analyzing CSV data to determine how many tables and what types of relationships needed to be defined between the tables.

# Data Engineering
We developed a database schema for each of your tables and relationships using our database model as a guide. 

# Data Analysis
Draft
